The Additional District and Sessions Court, Sealdah on (January 18, 2025) held accused Sanjay Roy “guilty” of rape and murder of an on-duty doctor at the state-run R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital.

The Court said that it finds the accused guilty on the basis of evidence put forward by the Central Bureau of India (CBI) for which the highest punishment will be death and least will be life imprisonment. The judge said the accused is being held guilty of Sections 64, 66, and 103 (1) of Bharatiya Nyay Samhita. The Judge informed Sanjay Roy that he had entered the hospital on August 9 and smothered the victim to death and committed sexual assault on her.
